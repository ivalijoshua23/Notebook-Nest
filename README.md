NotebookLM Pro Tree
A Chrome extension that transforms Google's NotebookLM from a simple list into a robust Project Management Dashboard.

Stop scrolling through endless flat lists. Organize your sources into nested trees, manage complex projects with advanced tasks, multi-window workflows, and focus with Zen Mode.

⚠️ Critical Warnings
Uninstalling Deletes Data: This extension uses Local Storage for privacy and speed. If you remove/uninstall the extension, your folders and tasks will be deleted instantly by Chrome.

Solution: Always use the Export button to save a backup JSON file before reinstalling or moving to a new computer.

Google Updates & Reliability: This extension works by "reading" the NotebookLM website. If Google updates their website, this extension may break.

Disclaimer: As this is a free, open-source project maintained in my spare time, I cannot guarantee immediate fixes if Google changes their code. Use this tool as a helpful enhancement, but keep your important data backed up.

🚧 Project Status & Disclaimer
Please Read: I am a Construction Project Manager, not a professional software developer. I built this tool because I needed it for my own daily workflow.

"Works on My Machine": This update (v17.9) is stable for my personal use, but it has not been battle-tested on every possible browser configuration.

Experimental Features: The multi-window system and DOM observers are complex. You may encounter bugs I haven't seen.

Feedback: If you find a bug, please open an issue on GitHub!

🚀 New in v17.9: The Productivity Suite
Transformed NotebookLM into a multi-window workspace. This update (consolidating v17.6–v17.9) brings major workflow improvements:

Pop-out Notes: Open any note in a floating window for side-by-side reference while you write. The pop-outs preserve formatting (read-only) and sync with your Light/Dark theme.

Smart Tasks & Quick Capture: Select text in any note to instantly see a "Create Task" button. This creates a task linked directly to that source note.

Advanced Task Management: Organize tasks into Custom Sections (collapsible groups), add Due Dates with quick-select options, and include rich Descriptions.

Graceful Stability: A new self-healing engine that disables specific broken features individually instead of crashing the whole extension if Google updates their code.

Features
📋 Productivity & Workflow
Multi-Window Workflow — Click the "Pop-out" icon on any note in the Studio panel to open it in a separate window. Perfect for dual-monitor setups.

Integrated Task Manager — A complete project management tool built right into the interface:

Sections: Group tasks by phase (e.g., "Research," "Drafting," "Review").

Smart Links: Tasks created from notes include a "Link" icon that filters your view to the original source.

Priorities: Flag tasks (Red/Yellow/Blue) and sort by Priority or Due Date.

"Zen Mode" — Toggle the UI to hide the AI chat and sidebars for a distraction-free reading/writing studio.

📂 Organization
Nested Folders — Create deep structures for Sources, Notes, and Generated Artifacts (Audio Overviews, FAQs, etc.).

Pinning — Keep critical contracts or specs pinned to the top of your lists.

Color Coding — Assign colors to folders for visual organization.

Bulk Select — Master checkboxes to select/deselect all sources in a folder or the entire notebook instantly.

🔍 Deep Search
Content Indexing — Search the actual text inside your notes, not just the titles.

Note: Indexing happens passively when you open a note.

Smart Compression — Uses LZ-String compression to store up to 5MB of search index data locally without impacting performance.

🛡️ Reliability
Local-First Architecture — Zero network latency. All data lives on your device.

Graceful Degradation — If a feature fails due to a website update, the rest of the extension keeps working.

Styled Dialogs — Smooth, themed confirmation dialogs (no more jarring browser popups).

Note: Each notebook has its own independent data. Tasks and Folders created in "Project A" won't clutter "Project B."

Local Storage: Folders, Tasks, Settings, and Search Index.

No Auto-Sync: Folders do not sync automatically between computers.

Moving Data: To move your setup to a laptop, use the Export button to get a JSON file, then Import on the new machine.

Privacy & Security
This extension is Local-First:

All data is stored in your browser's local storage.

No analytics or usage data is sent to the developer.

Known Limitations
Pop-out Editing: Pop-out windows are currently Read-Only. You must use the main window to edit text.
