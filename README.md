## ⚠️ Critical Warnings 

### Uninstalling Deletes Data
If you decide to uninstall this extension, all your folders and tasks will be removed instantly from your device due to Chrome's Local Storage. 

#### Solution:
Before uninstalling, always use the *Export* button within the extension. This creates a backup JSON file. You can then easily restore your data later.

### Google Updates & Reliability
This extension works by interacting with the NotebookLM website. If Google makes changes to their website, Notebook-Nest might stop functioning.

#### Disclaimer:
This is a free, open-source project. It is managed in my spare time, and while I will strive to fix issues quickly, I cannot guarantee immediate support.
